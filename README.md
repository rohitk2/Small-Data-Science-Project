# Small-Data-Science-Project

I just put some small data science projects I did.

# NBA Data Analysis Project

I scraped the data from an API: https://github.com/swar/nba_api via python. The data consists of all NBA team's statistics in a 25 year span (1996-7 to 2019-20). Using Matplotlib and Pandas I manipulated the data frame and showed a couple trends including questions such as:
(1) Overall trend of each team in the last 25 years.
(2) Which teams have been doing well recently?
(3) What factors correlate best with win percentage?
(4) Which NBA franchises have been the most dominant in the last 25 years?
